they are in the form: alias -> corresponding task

- d -> document the code, the documentation should be aimed at a senior software engineer, so no obvious redundancies, only 
        clear direct concise explanations
- s -> give style following the styling conventions of this project
- t -> write the tests for the code
- c -> add the missing details according to the comments given
- f -> fix
